# Why I Choose Static Sites

After years of working with various content management systems and dynamic frameworks, I've increasingly found myself reaching for static site generators. Here's why static sites have become my go-to choice for many projects.

## Performance That Just Works

Static sites are incredibly fast. When a user visits your site, they're served pre-built HTML files directly from a CDN. No database queries, no server-side processing, just pure speed.

**The results speak for themselves:**

- Lightning-fast page loads
- Excellent Core Web Vitals scores
- Better SEO rankings due to speed

## Security by Design

With static sites, there's simply less that can go wrong from a security perspective:

- No database to be compromised
- No server-side code to exploit
- Fewer moving parts mean fewer vulnerabilities

## Developer Experience

Modern static site generators offer an excellent development experience:

- **Live Reload**: See changes instantly during development
- **Modern Tooling**: Built with contemporary technologies
- **Version Control**: Your entire site is just files in a repository

## Cost-Effective Hosting

Static sites can be hosted almost anywhere, often for free:

- GitHub Pages
- Netlify
- Vercel
- Traditional web hosting

Many hosting platforms offer generous free tiers that are perfect for personal projects and small businesses.

## Scalability Without Complexity

Static sites handle traffic spikes gracefully. Whether you have 10 visitors or 10,000, your site performs consistently because:

- Content is cached at CDN edge locations
- No server resources are consumed per request
- Horizontal scaling is automatic

## When Static Sites Make Sense

Static sites work well for:

- **Blogs and content sites**
- **Portfolio websites**
- **Documentation**
- **Marketing pages**
- **Small business websites**

## When They Don't

Static sites aren't suitable for every project:

- Complex user authentication
- Real-time features
- Frequent content updates by non-technical users
- Heavy interactivity requirements

## The Modern Static Stack

Today's static site generators offer powerful features:

- **Build-time APIs**: Fetch data during build
- **Dynamic imports**: Load JavaScript on demand
- **Progressive enhancement**: Start with HTML, add interactivity
- **Incremental builds**: Only rebuild what changed

## Conclusion

Static sites aren't just a throwback to the early webâ€”they're a modern approach that solves many common problems elegantly. The combination of performance, security, and developer experience makes them an excellent choice for many projects.
