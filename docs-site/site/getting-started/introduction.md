# Getting Started with Stati

**Stati** is an open-source, TypeScript-first static site generator for documentation, blogs, and content-heavy websites. It features zero-config setup, fast esbuild bundling, file-based routing, and a developer-first workflow.

## What makes Stati different?

- **TypeScript-first**: Full type safety for configuration, plus built-in esbuild compilation for your client-side TypeScript
- **Modern tooling**: esbuild-powered bundling for development and production builds
- **ISG support**: Incremental Static Generation with intelligent caching
- **Minimal dependencies**: Focused and lightweight
- **Developer experience**: Hot reload, smart tooling, and great debugging

## Quick Overview

1. **[Installation](/getting-started/installation/)** - Install Stati and create your first site
2. **[Project Structure](/getting-started/project-structure/)** - Understanding how Stati organizes your files
3. **[Quick Start Guide](/getting-started/quick-start/)** - Build your first site step by step

## Philosophy

Stati follows these core principles:

- **Simplicity over complexity** - Keep things simple and focused
- **Sensible defaults** - Works out of the box with minimal configuration
- **Developer experience first** - Great tooling and debugging experience
- **Modern standards** - Built with modern web technologies
